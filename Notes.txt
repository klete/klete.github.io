Setting up with GitHub

1. Created a repo on github

2. Cloned the repo

  $ git clone https://github.com/kklete/klete.github.io

  Didn't need the trailing ".git".

3. Created the index.html file

  $ echo "Hello World" > index.html

4. Upload to github

  $ git add --all
  $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
  $ git push -u origin master

5. Go to the website

  https://klete.github.io


Using a Custom URL

The documentation is confusing.

1. Add the custom domain, www.krittger.net, to github via the settings for the klete.github.io repo.
2. Set the CNAME record in Route53.  www.krittger.net points to klete.github.io.
3. Back in the github repo settings, remove and re-add the custom domain to trigger the process of enabling https.

The ssl cert was issued within a few minutes.  I could tell because the message next to the https checkbox in the settings updated with the change in status.

4. Select 'Enforce HTTPS"

Going back to www.krittger.net and reloading forced https but also gave a "certificate is invalid" message.  This resolved by itself in a minute or two.

The certificate appears to only be valid for five months.
